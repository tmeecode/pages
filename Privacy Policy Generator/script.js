This Privacy Policy explains how <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> collects, uses, and discloses information, and your choices for managing your information preferences.</p><p>This Privacy Policy describes <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s data practices associated with our website (<a class="website_url"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE URL]</span></a>) and <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> services ("Services"), and the choices that <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> provides in connection with our collection and use of your information. This Privacy Policy is intended for website publisher customers ("Publishers"), website merchant customers ("Merchants") and individual users of websites and apps.

These policies may differ from <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s policies described in this Privacy Policy. Please consult the privacy policies of the websites you visit and apps you use to become familiar with their privacy practices and to learn about any choices that these companies may offer with respect to their information practices. In addition, any website containing our Services may contain links to websites or content operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">1. Information Collection and Use</strong><br><br><p><span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> collects data in a variety of ways - including through the use of log files, pixel tags, cookies, and/or similar technologies. Examples of the types of data that we collect are:</p><br><ul><li>Browser information (e.g. URL, browser type, ‘click through’ data);</li><li>Ad reporting or delivery data (e.g. size/type of ad, ad impressions, location/format of ad, data about interactions with the ad);</li><li>Device-type information (e.g. screen dimensions, device brand and model);</li><li>Information about your activities on our website and Services.</li></ul><br><p>We may combine information that does not directly identify an individual with data collected from other sources and disclose the combined information to participating publishers, advertisers and ad networks so that they can determine whether to bid on ad inventory and in order to improve the relevance of the advertising presented to users. We also use the information we collect to host, operate, maintain, secure, and further develop and improve our Services, such as to keep track of advertising delivery and to measure the effectiveness of advertising delivered through our Services, and investigate compliance with <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s policies and terms and conditions. Some of the third parties that we work with may contribute additional data to us directly, which we may combine with our own in order to help us provide a better service. We do not collect any information that could be used to directly identify an individual.</p><p><span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> does not engage in activities that require parental notice or consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you believe that <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> has inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 that is subject to parental notice and consent under COPPA, please contact <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> using the contact information below to request deletion of the information.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">2. Cookies and Other Similar Technologies.</strong><br><br><p>We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser), Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage), pixels, etags, and similar technologies to operate and improve our website and Services, including for interest-based advertising as described below. Some of our Service Providers (defined below) may also use such technologies in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">3. Information Sharing</strong><br><br><p>We will disclose contact and billing information to third parties only as described in this Privacy Policy:</p><br><ul><li>with your express permission;</li><li>with our affiliates, which include entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>;</li><li>where we contract with third parties to provide certain services, such as advertising, analytics, data management services, web hosting, and web development ("Service Providers"). We ask Service Providers to confirm that their privacy and security practices are consistent with ours, we provide our Service Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform the services we request, and Service Providers are prohibited from using such information for purposes other than as specified by <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>;</li><li>in the event that <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> is merged, sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets (including in bankruptcy), or in the event of another corporate change, we may disclose or transfer information in connection with such transaction; and</li><li>where we believe it is necessary to protect <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> or our users; to enforce our terms or the legal rights of <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> or others; or to comply with a request from governmental authorities, legal process, or other legal obligations.</li></ul><br><p>We may also share and disclose other information that we collect, including aggregate information, as we consider necessary to develop and provide our Services, including in the ways described above. The information that we share in this way would not be considered to personally identify an individual.</p><p><span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> may also be required to disclose information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">4. Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out</strong><br><br><p><span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles in the US and to the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Principles in the EU and the IAB Europe OBA Framework.</p><p>The <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> Ad Exchange uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels, etags, and similar technologies to give Publishers the possibility to offer, and Ad Exchange advertisers the ability to show, targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a different device. These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use data collected across non-affiliated apps over time. This is called "interest-based advertising." In addition, certain third parties may collect data on the <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> website and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include interest-based advertising.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">5. Opting Out for Cookie-Based Services</strong><br><br><p>If you would like to learn more about this type of advertising, or would prefer to opt out of website interest-based advertising enabled by <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s Ad Exchange, European Union residents may opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the EDAA at www.youronlinechoices.com and all other users may visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. Please note that in order for your opt-out choice to be effective using this tool, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> opt-out cookie. Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, and you may need to change your browser settings to accept third-party cookies before opting out.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">6. Opting Out for Certain Non-Cookie Services (in applicable countries)</strong><br><br><p>To help identify your browser and/or possible relationships between different browsers and devices, <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> or our partners may use the local storage or cache in your browser. Using the browser cache or local storage helps <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> or our partners deliver interest-based advertising to a browser without the use of third-party cookies. We are using local storage only for application processing, not for any tracking processes. To opt out of <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s use of local storage or the browser cache to provide its services, please (1) use any tools provided by your browser to clear local storage and the browser cache, and (2) turn on any "Do Not Track" header setting offered by your browser. As long as the two steps are completed and maintained on a browser, <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> will not use local storage or the cache on that browser to identify and sync browsers and devices. If you also want to opt out of <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s use of third-party cookies for interest-based advertising as enabled by <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s Ad Exchange, please see instructions above.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">7. Opting Out for Mobile Application Data</strong><br><br><p>To opt out of <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s collection, use, and transfer of data for interest-based advertising on mobile apps, you may download the DAA’s AppChoices application from the Android or iOS app store on your mobile device. Generated by <a href="https://termzy.io" style="text-decoration:none;color:black;cursor:auto;">Termzy.io</a>. Users outside the United States may not have access to this application; instead, you can use "Limit Ad Tracking" in your iOS settings or "Opt out of interest-based ads" in your Android settings to limit <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s collection of data for interest-based advertising.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">8. Opting Out for Location Data</strong><br><br><p>You may opt out of our collection, use, and transfer of precise location data by using the location services controls in your mobile device’s settings.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">9. Effect of Opting Out</strong><br><br><p>If you use a different device or browser, or erase cookies from your browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.</p><p>If you opt out of <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span>’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies. Third-party advertisers and ad networks that participate in the <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> Ad Exchange may also use their own cookies and other ad service technologies to display and track their ads. We do not control and are not responsible for such third-party advertisers’ and ad networks’ information practices or their use of cookies and other ad service technologies. To learn more about the practices of these companies, please read their privacy policies.<p>Even if you opt-out, <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> may continue to collect data for other purposes and you still will receive advertising from the <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> Ad Exchange when you visit websites of a Publisher who uses our Services – but such advertising will not be targeted to you.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">10.

International Information Transfers</strong><br><br><p>Please be aware that the information we collect, including contact and billing information, may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that we process and store information in the United States and your consent to this Privacy Policy or use of <span class="website_name"><span class="dashed">[WEBSITE NAME]</span></span> Services represents your agreement to this processing.</p><br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;">12.
